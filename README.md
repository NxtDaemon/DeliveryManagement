# Delivery Toolkit 
Within messing around with HTB machines I often need to serve up WinPEAS or LinPEAS , LinEnum, etc <br>
to streamline this Delivery Toolkit will manage and serve up files, it will use the following methods
- Python Updog http server 
- Impacket SMB server 
- SCP 
- FTP 

this project was formerly called UpdogManagement tool but since realising there is a much better way of <br> 
programming this so over the next couple of weeks.
