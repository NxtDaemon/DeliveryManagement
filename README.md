# UpdogManagement Utility 
Within messing around with HTB machines I often need to serve up WinPEAS or LinPEAS , etc etc <br>
so within the mindset of typing very little I've made this little python script, if you would like to use it <br>
all you need to do is to modify the conf.json file with the absolute paths of the directories for updog to serve up
